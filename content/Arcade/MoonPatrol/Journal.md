Guy Shavit asked me about assets for Moon Patrol to use in a project he is working on. That got me started on
the dig again.

I made a sprite-to-png converter and ran it on the sprites and backgrounds images. The text tiles are
more difficult since the game reuses them with different color palettes.

I will make an "asset" directory with an index file and all the pngs.
