I have everything commented and an emulator running. That'll do for now.

I got the basic TRS80 and HauntedHouse pages up on computerarcheology.

The very first part of the first program is the cassette routine to load the

completely separate programs. I commented the loader routine.

I found the command-tables in both floors.
