A bug in the TRS80/CoCo versions:

In the "else" of the "climb" in room 80. The "move to" should be in the block above it. The MoveTo is always the last
thing that happens everywhere else. It should be here too.

I found a 6809 emulator on github. I am wiring it up to the pyramid site so you can
play the game in emulation. That'll work for the other games too ... except for
Madness and the Minotaur which has real-time interrupt driven features.
