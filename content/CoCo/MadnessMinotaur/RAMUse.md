%%title = Madness and the Minotaur RAM Use

Init clears 00-66 inclusive. The area is in BASIC's memory usage. The code uses some of
BASIC's routines, but this first area of memory is for the BASIC interpreter. The code
can overwrite this area without interfering with the BASIC calls it uses.

# Blocked Rooms 

Shifting buffer of rooms blocked by Shaking Ground.
As new rooms are blocked at random, they go on the
end of the list. Rooms are pulled off of the front
of the list and unblocked completely. This keeps
lots of shaking from blocking up the floors over
time.
